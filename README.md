# 📊 Test Score Analyzer: Data-Driven Insights  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Test Score Analyzer** is a Java program designed to process an array of test scores, compute statistical values, and provide insights into student performance. By determining the **highest score, lowest score, average, median, and the difference between average and median**, this program offers a quick yet effective analysis of test data.

## 🚀 Features  
📊 **Automatic Score Analysis** – Computes **average, median, and difference** instantly ✅  
📈 **High & Low Score Detection** – Identifies the **highest and lowest test scores** 📌  
🔄 **Dynamic Calculation** – Works with any list of test scores, ensuring flexibility 🔢  
🖨️ **Formatted Output** – Displays results with **two decimal precision** for accuracy 🎯

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. 📥 **The program initializes an array** of test scores.  
2. 🔎 It loops through the array to:  
   - 🏆 Identify the **highest score**  
   - 📉 Identify the **lowest score**  
   - ➕ Calculate the **sum of all scores**  
3. 📊 **The average score is computed** by dividing the total sum by the number of scores.  
4. 🏛 **The median** is determined as the midpoint between the **highest and lowest scores**.  
5. 📉 **The difference** between the **average and median** is calculated to assess score distribution.  
6. 📝 The program **prints the results**, neatly formatted to two decimal places.
